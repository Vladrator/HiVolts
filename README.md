# HiVolts

## Introduction: 
This program uses javaFX and other extensions in order create a game called HiVolts. This game has a 12 by 12 (change be changed) board that has mhoa (enemies) and an avatar (you). The avatar can be controlled by the player and the mhos will follow the player and attempt to kill them. The game has all the controls as the original game has and has lots of comments that help comprehension.

## How this fulfills / does not fulfill the specification:
This program fulfills all the expectations and does more as it uses animations and is a modern take on the old game

## Explanation of current errors (or anything that falls short of project specifications) and how you might fix them:
There are no known errors

## Overview of the code explaining, in broad strokes, the structure of it:
The code is split up into 6 classes that work together to create teh game. There is a main class that orginizes the code and there is a class for mhos, fences and the avatar. Furthermore the actuall movements are directed by a specific class the moves both the avatar and mhos

## Discussion of major challenges encountered in the process of making the code:
Using javaFX, a new and unknown application of java was very difficult as we had to learn it and work with it. Another challenge was getting the mhos to move correctly as the mhos have to figure out on their own how to move and that was very difficult to do, as the logic was very complicated.

## Another major challenge was getting javaFX to work on the computer as it was very difficult to get it actually work and have teh javaFX libraries and abilities as the current java was not able to.
To fix this one has to use the bottom two links to either download jdk 8 or use Gluon to add it.

## Acknowledgements (who helped you, what resources you used etc.):
I worked in a group with Presley and Aaron and we all worked to complete this code
